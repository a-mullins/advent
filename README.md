# Advent of Code
My personal Advent of Code solutions, each year with a different language:
- 2015: Python
- 2016: JavaScript (node)
- 2017: C

I didn't write these solutions to necessarily handle every possible input or
failure mode, so the code in this repository shouldn't be used in any production
environment without modification. After all, in Advent of Code we know exactly
which inputs we feed into our programs, so it doesn't seem sensible to make the
solutions fuzzing-proof.

Instead I tried to write code that implemented the solutions in a
straight-forward and idiomatic style, so that they might be useful to others who
are learning these languages or solving the same puzzles.

Possible future langs:
APL, C++, Haksell, Kotlin, Lisp, Perl, Prolog, Smalltalk
