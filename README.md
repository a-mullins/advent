# Advent of Code
My personal [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions, each year
with a different language:
- 2015: Python
- 2016: JavaScript (node)
- 2017: C (in progress)

I hope these solutions can be useful to those who are seeking hints or
learning these languages. I have made them as straight-forward and idiomatic
as I can, and I chose to omit error handling and input sanity checking where
possible for the sake of readability and brevity. Let that also be a warning
against using snippets from here in production without modification.

Possible future languages:
Ada, APL, C++, Haksell, Kotlin, Lisp, Perl, Prolog, Smalltalk, Swift
