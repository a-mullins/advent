- `const` is not used in this code at the moment. These solutions are small
  and there is only one author. Also, where do you use it? It is pointless on
  params that are passed by value, so....
- TODO: implement const
- Generally, errors from *alloc()s are not checked, nor are the implicit
  allocs of getline, &c. This is bad practice in production, but acceptable
  here.
- Is there a way to get the compiler to warn about unknown-param funct
  declarations? In other words, it should flag `void foo();` but not `void
  foo(void);`
- In function param, prefer passing pointers instead of arrays. That is,
  `foo(int *matrix)` vs `foo(int matrix[])`.
- Avoid VLAs, they make stack frame sizes unpredictable and potentially
  bloated.
- sizeof (int) not sizeof(int), to emphasize that sizeof is a statement not a
  function.
- Clever trick for trimming a string: `buf[strcspn(buf, "\r\n")] = '\0';`

- day07 is getting at the idea of self-balancing trees, like AVL or
  Red-Black trees.
